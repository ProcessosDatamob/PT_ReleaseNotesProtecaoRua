# Technical Description of the Protection Solution - Android

### **Solution Presentation**

The Street Mode is a security application developed for Android and iOS devices that allows users to protect access to specific apps or app categories based on geofences (trusted locations). It is possible to register up to 20 trusted locations and configure automatic app blocking when leaving these geographic areas. This solution provides an additional layer of security, ensuring that sensitive applications remain inaccessible outside of secure locations.
